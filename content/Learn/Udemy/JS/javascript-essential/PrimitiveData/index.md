## Primitive

Primitive just means basic. You can think of like a primitive human being like a caveman. It just means basic. basic data. And you will not be able to create an application with out basic primitive data.

String, Integer, Floats, Boolean, null, undefined and there is NaN

### NaN

Finally you have the primitive type which is NaN. And what this actually means is not a number.

So if you wanted to check to see if let's say a variable or a part of your program has a number stored within it and let's say if it's not a number then you will get this primitive type return.

So you know not to use this variable all this value in your mathematical expression for example.

So Nan just means not a number.
So they're all your primitive types what you have first of all is

1. a string either by single or double quotes.
2. You have integers which are whole numbers and you have floating point numbers which have the decimal place and then their fractional numbers.
3. Then also you have boolean such as true and false.
4. Next you have null an undefined.
5. And then finally you have NaN which means not a number.

There are your basic primitive types and by using these basic pieces of data you have primitive data.
